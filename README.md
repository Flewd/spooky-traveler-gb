# spooky-traveler-gb
gameboy game made for GGJ 2021

My first attempt to learn and make a GameBoy game using GameBoy Development Kit 2020 (GBDK) and the C programming language.

You can play it on any GameBoy emulator on your PC! 



BGB is a small easy to use emulator that you can download here: https://bgb.bircd.org/ 
Load SpookyTraveler.gb in the emulator

Tools used to make the game: GBDK2020: https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020
